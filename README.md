# todo-Django
One stop solution to maintain your daily tasks in efficient way
The project is all about managing todo's on daily basis in efficient manner.
You can create,update and update status based on one's requirement.
This app also uses authentication to authenticate users.
I have used Python, Django, PostgreSQL and REST API (End point creation) as primary interface also provided an admin dashboard using Djangoâ€™s Admin Site system (for User Management).
